These are the source files for my personal blog made with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).

During the design process I tried to keep it all simple and bloat-free, as this is a static web and heavy javascript imports could compromise performance.

Some **features** on my blog are:

 - 🌙 Dark mode
 - 📋 Copy button on code blocks
 - 🔍 Search tool made with [Fuse.js](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse)
 - 🏷️ Filter by tags
