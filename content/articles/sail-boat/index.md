The existence of true river transport is attested from the Mesolithic period by the remains of boats and oars, and in the Neolithic period by stone engravings depicting rowing boats. However, it is the development of human civilization from the 4th millennium BC that gives it the final push.

Rivers, easily navigable, allow for the transportation of products from farming regions to cities and villages and encourage the development of all forms of river transport.

However, these are still rowing boats. Herodotus describes the river navigation of the Babylonians as follows: "They have boats that go down the river to Babylon, and they are round and entirely made of leather. In order for the boat to maintain its course, it requires two oars operated by two men on foot." Herodotus also mentions the boats of the fishermen of the Indus, which, as he says, "go fishing in boats made of reeds: a single section of reed, from one knot to another, provides them with a boat."

# Egyptian origin

The Egyptians were the first to provide evidence of sail navigation. Representations of it can be found as far back as the Old Kingdom in bas-reliefs and funerary paintings. The oldest evidence dates from the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, but the characteristics of later sailboats remained the same: a vessel with raised bow and stern, no deck, and a trapezoidal sail made of papyrus or linen. It was operated using halyards, held in place by shrouds, and raised on a double or single mast, often collapsible.

These boats also had a row of oars and were steered with the help of a steering oar or two large rudders located on both sides of the hull.

The Egyptian origin of the sailboat can be explained by the Egyptians' experience in shipbuilding. Indeed, the Egyptians were accomplished naval architects, building sophisticated boats since the Neolithic period and maintaining very active shipyards during the reign of the pharaohs. They were also experienced sailors, accustomed to navigating rivers, lakes, and canals. For example, the oldest known logbook is an Egyptian papyrus.

# "The 'Great Green' and the Red Sea

On the other hand, the country's geographical position encourages this development.
Indeed, Egypt opens onto two economically significant seas: the Mediterranean, known as the 'Great Green' in Egyptian texts, and the Red Sea.
Therefore, the Egyptians have a great interest in developing their naval technology, unlike the Mesopotamians or the people of the Sind.

For the former, the Euphrates River flows into a nearly closed sea surrounded by deserts; for the latter, the Indus flows into an empty ocean.
This explains why the Egyptians are the first to abandon solely river navigation to embark on the conquest of the seas."

# The First Expeditions

![Temple of Obelisks in Byblos](biblos-ruins)

Since the Ancient Empire, their ships have been sailing along the eastern Mediterranean coast, heading towards Byblos in search of precious woods for palace chambers; to Cyprus and Cilicia to acquire copper and silver; and finally, to the Aegean Sea to bring back manufactured goods.
To the south, Egyptian sailors descend to the shores of the Indian Ocean in search of ebony, ivory, incense, spices, gold, and wild animals.

It is they who organize the first expeditions in history.
They then pass on their knowledge to the Phoenicians, who prove to be tireless sailors, and whose "great Tarshish ships" remain, throughout antiquity, synonymous with high-sea vessels.
